# The Shortest History of Germany

- The book quotes [The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire) very often, by simply saying `(Gibbon)`.

## Proto (500 BC - 58 BC)

- Tsar Vladimir, Vladimir the Great: 958-1015
- [Joschka Fischer, The End of the West, 5 Dec 2016](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2016/12/is-this-the-end-of-the-west-asks-joschka-fischer/)
- First record via *quis vs was* is around `500 BC`, north of Rhine and Elbe, well over Danube. Most south being around Lower Saxony and then to current Denmark and South Sweden, around Stockholm.
	- `Danube`: From Black Forest to Black Sea. Second longest river in Europe
	- `Rhine`: From Swiss Alps to North Sea
	- `Elbe`: From Giant Mountains (Czech) to North Sea, over Rhine. This is the one that Spree flows into 
- Around 150 BC proto-Germans had started interacting with the Mediterranean world, civilisation.
- They were considered just generic barbarians. *No one ever called anyone a German until 58 BC*. 

## Takeover (58 BC - 526 AD)

- Marcus Tullius Cicero: 03.01.106 - 07.12.43 BC
- Julius Caesar: 12.07.100 - 15.03.44 BC
- Caesar names them: *Germani*. [First description](https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_bello_Gallico/Liber_VI#22) of them are given in `Commentarii de Bello Gallico`, book 6, 21-28.
- An inspiring passage from the [translation](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0001%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D21):
	> "*Those who have remained chaste for the longest time, receive the greatest commendation among their people; they think that by this the growth is promoted, by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews are strengthened. And to have had knowledge of a woman before the twentieth year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts...*"
- Caesar was governer of Cisalpine Gaul, a Roman province, now most of nothern Italy
- [Battle of Vosges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vosges_(58_BC))
- On receipt of reports that Caesar had attacked during a truce but won a victory in which he killed some 430 thousand Germans, Cato the Younger objected to it as a sacrilege and demanded Caesar's surrender to the Germans. None joined him.
- `Battle of the Teutoburg Forest`: September 8–11, 9 AD, considered one of the most important defeats in Roman history, bringing the triumphant period of expansion under Augustus to an abrupt end. It dissuaded the Romans from pursuing the conquest of Germania, and so can be considered *one of the most important events in European history*.
- *"The Rhineland was secure again. The Roman army, like all armies, preferred tough boys from the backwoods to city youths, and the Germans now became their most-favoured recruits."*
- All the greatest cities of future Austria and West German except Hamburg grew up within the Roman Empire.
-  Jacobite rising of 1745, Highland Scots tried to invade England. As soon as they are beaten, the British Army began using them as shock-troops, and the English public romanticized invaders. So it was with the Romans and Germans in 100 AD, see [Germania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania_(book)).
-  The Goths are the first barbarians ever to kill a Roman Emperor, in 251 AD. By the fourth century, they'd become the first Christian, literate Germans, and had even translated the Bible from Greek into Gothic.
-  In 378 AD Goths killed Emperor Valens at the [Battle of Adrianople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Adrianople) (Edirne). The battle is often considered the start of the events which led to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. 
-  Some Latin: *de facto* vs *de jure*. Here `de` means of/by/about/concerning. Like in *Commentarii de Bello Gallico*.
-  Theodoric the Great (454-526 AD), see [Mausoleum of Theodoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_Theodoric#/media/File:Mausoleum_of_Theodoric_(Ravenna)_-_Exterior.jpg). He provided thirty years of stable rule in Italy, a first since Constantine two centuries earlier.

## Restoration (526 AD - 983 AD)

- Merovingians ran their Franco-German empire through Latin codices which mixed tribal Germanic laws with the Roman legal heritage, around 700 AD. See [Leges Visigothorum](https://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/0506-0506,_AA_VV,_Leges_Romanae_Visigotorum_[Scott_JP_Curatore],_EN.pdf). They were able to stand their ground and filled the power vacuum after the dislocations, such as Gothic Wars.
- Foederati were peoples and cities bound by a treaty, known as foedus, with Rome.
- [Battle of Tours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tours )was fought on 10.10.732, was an important battle during the Umayyad invasion of Gaul.
- In 753 AD, Stephen II became the first Pope ever to journey north of the Alps. See [donation of Pepin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Pepin).
- Charlemagne (748-	814), king of Franks, Lombards and Emperor of the Carolingian Empire was the first recognised emperor to rule from the west after the fall of the Western Roman Empire approximately three centuries earlier. Charlemagne's reign was marked by political and social changes that had lasting influence on Europe throughout the Middle Ages.
- The Hildebrandslied is the earliest poetic text in German. See [Rostam and Sohrab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostam_and_Sohrab) in Şahname.
- Origin of `deutsch`: [`theodisce`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodiscus), around 800 AD.
