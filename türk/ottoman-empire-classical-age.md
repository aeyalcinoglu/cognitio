- Iranian imperial continuity: [Achaemenid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire) (550–330 BC), [Parthian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire) (247 BC-224 AD), [Sasanian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) (224–651). After the Mongol conquests, the [Ilkhanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkhanate) (1256–1335) (İlhanlılar) ruled Persia as a Chinggisid khanate, often in rivalry (and diplomacy) with the [Golden Horde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde) (Altın Ordu Devleti) to the north.
- The [Amu Darya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amu_Darya) (Ceyhun) and [Syr Darya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syr_Darya) (Seyhun) rise in the mountains of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, flow northwest toward the Aral Sea, and the region between them is known as [Transoxiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transoxiana) ([Maveraünnehir](https://www.nisanyansozluk.com/kelime/Maveraünnehir)).
- Excluding the Shia, Islamic history includes four major caliphates: the [Rashidun Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate) (632–661), [the Umayyad Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate) (661–750), the [Abbasid Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate) (750–1258), and the Ottoman Caliphate (1517–1924).
- In [Josippon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josippon), 950, [Togarmah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togarmah) is presented as an ancestor of Turkic peoples, with his descendants identified as groups such as the Göktürks, Oghuz, and others.
- [The Huns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns) (or even [Xiongnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiongnu)) first projected proto-Turkic power across the steppes and triggered the [Great Migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period). Their identity was shaped by origin myths like [Asena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asena) and the [Epic of Ergenekon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Ergenekon), which centered on a symbolic rebirth in the [Altai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai-Sayan_region). By the 6th century, the [Göktürks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Göktürks) established the first empire to use "Turk" as an official political name. Later, the [Oghuz tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oghuz_Turks) rose to prominence and adopted the name [Turkoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkoman_(ethnonym)) as they moved into the Islamic world by the 10th century.
- [Orkhon Inscriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkhon_inscriptions) (8th century): Earliest Turkic writings. Bilingual texts in Middle Chinese and Old Turkic, honoring Göktürk rulers, explaining Turkic rule, values, leadership.
- [Bertrand Russell, 1948](https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/1948_reith3.pdf): I cannot think of anything that mankind has gained by the existence of Jenghis Khan.
- [The Seljuk Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Empire) (1037–1194) emerged as [Tuğrul Bey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tughril_I) led Oghuz tribes into the Iranian plateau and challenged both eastern Islamic powers and Byzantine Empire. Adopting Persian administration and the [Nizamiyyah system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nezamiyeh), the Seljuks consolidated rule, defeated Byzantium at [Manzikert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manzikert) (1071), accelerated the Turkification of Anatolia, peaked under [Malik-Shah I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik-Shah_I), and later fragmented into regional [atabey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atabeg) states.

## An Outline of Ottoman History, 1300-1600
- Initial question is: "How did Osman Gazi's small frontier principality, dedicated to a Holy War against Christian Byzantium, grow to be an empire of such power?". [H.A. Gibbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Adams_Gibbons) speculates that it is a revival of the Byzantine Empire as a Muslim state. Mehmet Fuat Köprülü disagrees in [The Origins of the Ottoman Empire](https://cityofconstantine.com/books/the_origins_of_the_ottoman_empire).
- There is a parallel between how Rome recruited German soldiers and the [Mamluk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk) forces. The Mamluk system originated in the Abbasid Caliphate in the 9th century CE, recruiting enslaved Turkic and Caucasian youths for military service.
- Inalcik marks [Battle of Bapheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bapheus), 1302, as the founding of the state. Other frontier principalities flocked behind.
- The Ottoman State didn't have the orthodoxy of the hinterland and developed after the raids of the [gazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazi_(warrior)). The state aimed to treat all races as one, unite Orthodox Christian Balkans and Muslim Anatolia. Tolerance in exchange for poll-tax, [haraç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haraç).
- The case of [Mihal Gazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Köse_Mihal), a Greek lord is a famous example of the assimilation.
