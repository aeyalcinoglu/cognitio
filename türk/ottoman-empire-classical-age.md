- Iranian imperial continuity: [Achaemenid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire) (550–330 BC), [Parthian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire) (247 BC-224 AD), [Sasanian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) (224–651). After the Mongol conquests, the [Ilkhanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkhanate) (1256–1335) (İlhanlılar) ruled Persia as a Chinggisid khanate, often in rivalry (and diplomacy) with the [Golden Horde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde) (Altın Ordu Devleti) to the north.
- The [Amu Darya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amu_Darya) (Ceyhun) and [Syr Darya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syr_Darya) (Seyhun) rise in the mountains of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, flow northwest toward the Aral Sea, and the region between them is known as [Transoxiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transoxiana) ([Maveraünnehir](https://www.nisanyansozluk.com/kelime/Maveraünnehir)).
- Excluding the Shia, Islamic history includes four major caliphates: the [Rashidun Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate) (632–661), the [Umayyad Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate) (661–750), the [Abbasid Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate) (750–1258), and the Ottoman Caliphate (1517–1924).
- In [Josippon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josippon), 950, [Togarmah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togarmah) is presented as an ancestor of Turkic peoples, with his descendants identified as groups such as the Göktürks, Oghuz, and others.
- [The Huns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns) (or even [Xiongnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiongnu)) first projected proto-Turkic power across the steppes and triggered the [Great Migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period). Their identity was shaped by origin myths like [Asena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asena) and the [Epic of Ergenekon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Ergenekon), which centered on a symbolic rebirth in the [Altai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai-Sayan_region). By the 6th century, the [Göktürks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Göktürks) established the first empire to use "Turk" as an official political name. Later, the [Oghuz tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oghuz_Turks) rose to prominence and adopted the name [Turkoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkoman_(ethnonym)) as they moved into the Islamic world by the 10th century.
- [Orkhon Inscriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkhon_inscriptions) (8th century): Earliest Turkic writings. Bilingual texts in Middle Chinese and Old Turkic, honoring Göktürk rulers, explaining Turkic rule, values, leadership.
- [Bertrand Russell, 1948](https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/1948_reith3.pdf): I cannot think of anything that mankind has gained by the existence of Jenghis Khan.
- [The Seljuk Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Empire) (1037–1194) emerged as [Tuğrul Bey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tughril_I) led Oghuz tribes into the Iranian plateau and challenged both eastern Islamic powers and Byzantine Empire. Adopting Persian administration and the [Nizamiyyah system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nezamiyeh), the Seljuks consolidated rule, defeated Byzantium at [Manzikert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manzikert) (1071), accelerated the Turkification of Anatolia, peaked under [Malik-Shah I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik-Shah_I), and later fragmented into regional [atabey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atabeg) states.

## An Outline of Ottoman History, 1300-1600
- Initial question is: "How did Osman Gazi's small frontier principality, dedicated to a Holy War against Christian Byzantium, grow to be an empire of such power?". [H.A. Gibbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Adams_Gibbons) speculates that it is a revival of the Byzantine Empire as a Muslim state. Mehmet Fuat Köprülü disagrees in [The Origins of the Ottoman Empire](https://cityofconstantine.com/books/the_origins_of_the_ottoman_empire).
- There is a parallel between how Rome recruited German soldiers and the [Mamluk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk) forces. The Mamluk system originated in the Abbasid Caliphate in the 9th century CE, recruiting enslaved Turkic and Caucasian youths for military service.
- Inalcik marks [Battle of Bapheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bapheus), 1302, as the founding of the principality. Other frontier principalities flocked behind.
- The Ottoman State didn't have the orthodoxy of the hinterland and developed after the raids of the [gazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazi_(warrior)). The state aimed to treat all races as one, unite Orthodox Christian Balkans and Muslim Anatolia. Tolerance in exchange for poll-tax, [haraç](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haraç).
- The case of [Mihal Gazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Köse_Mihal), a Greek lord is a famous example of the assimilation.
- In 1346, Orhan had made an alliance with a claimant to the Byzantine throne and had married his daughter, [Theodora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodora_Kantakouzene_(wife_of_Orhan)). Later in March 1354, with [Fall of Gallipoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Gallipoli), Ottomans established themselves on European soil.

- After the [Ottoman conquest of Adrianople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_conquest_of_Adrianople), 1361, the government encouraged Turks from Anatolia to settle in Europe, [zaviyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zawiya_(institution)) became the nuclei of new Turkish villages and created a firm base in [Thrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrace). By 1372 Ottomans were the master of the Balkan peninsula, and they again brought nomads from Anatolia, including powerful [yürük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yörüks) groups.
- [Janissaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janissary) were the first modern standing army, and perhaps the first infantry force in the world to be equipped with firearms. Inalcik says first standing army in Europe. They are made up through the [devşirme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devshirme) system.
- The Ottoman invasion of the Balkans coincided with a time of political fragmentation. The Greek Orthodox populations were fanatically opposed to all Latin influences. This and Janissaries account for the ease of Ottoman conquest in the Balkans.
- Byzantine Empire was losing control of [pronoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoia) lands, a Byzantine system granting tax income for service. Ottomans again brought state control and converted them to [timars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timar) or distributed to the [yayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaya_(military)). For the peasantry new regime was an improvement.
- The Ottomans frequently used the policy of legitimization when attacking their Muslim neighbours in the east. See [Battle of Frenkyazısı (1387)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Frenkyazısı_(1387)). Their aggression was hidden behind gifts and purchasing and if attacked they considered it as an attack to the Holy War. They broadcasted the charges through [fetvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatwa) to the entire Islamic world. 
- See [Battle of Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kosovo), one of the largest battles of the Late Middle Ages. Inalcik says that it firmly established Ottoman rule in the Balkans. Murad I was killed during this war, only Ottoman Sultan killed on the battlefield.
- Bayezid I won [Battle of Nicopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nicopolis) (Niğbolu), 1396, against crusades, greatly raising the Ottoman prestige in the Islamic world and became a greater threat to Central Europe. Later in 1402, [Timur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur) defeated Ottomans in the [Battle of Ankara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ankara) and took Bayezid prisoner. This led to the 11 years long [Ottoman Interregnum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Interregnum) (Fetret devri).
- How did the Ottomans make this recovery so quickly after the rout at Ankara, surrounded by civil war and uprisings? Janissary corps, merchants preferring the Ottomans instead of feudal regimes and the prestige of being the greatest leader of the Holy War.
- The empire was not truly united until 1453, and until then [Mehmed I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_I) (1413-21) and [Murad II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murad_II) (1421-44, 46-51) dealt with constant wars. There were also internal power struggles, for example Mehmed I's brother [Küçük Mustafa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Küçük_Mustafa) was supported by the Byzantine Empire and married into the imperial family.
- Unlike European monarchies, the Ottoman Empire had no hereditary aristocracy outside the ruling dynasty. See [Çandarlı family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Çandarlı_family), [Köprülü family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Köprülü_family), [Zaganos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagan_Pasha) and [Şihabeddin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadım_Şehabeddin).
- Murad II's victory in [Battle of Varna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Varna) (1444) sealed the fate of the Balkans and the Byzantine Empire.

- [Rumelihisarı](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumelihisarı) was built by [Mehmed II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_II) (1444-6, 1451-81) in 1452; [Anadoluhisarı](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anadoluhisarı) was built by Bayezid I in 1394. [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople) was the historic walled peninsula, today’s old Istanbul district.
- "The siege of Constantinople lasted fifty-four days, from 6 April to 29 May 1453. The defending force numbered some 8,500 men; the regular Ottoman army numbered not less than fifty thousand."
- "Mehmed entered the city in procession, stopped the pillage, and went to the [Hagia Sophia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia) and prayed. He converted the church into a mosque and proclaimed 'Hereafter my capital is Istanbul'". 
- The Ottomans established the Danube as the empire's natural northern frontier. Mehmed's main task in the Balkans was to undermine Hungarian influence.
- [Republic of Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice) (697–1797): A Venetian-led [lagoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Lagoon) polity that replaced earlier Byzantine-era administration and grew into a maritime trading republic, ending when Napoleon dissolved it in 1797.
- [Uzun Hasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzun_Hasan) (1425–78): Ruler of the Akkoyunlular confederation who built a major power in eastern Anatolia and Iran, fought the Ottomans (notably defeated at [Otlukbeli in 1473](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Otlukbeli)). Timur had appointed Uzun Hasan's grandfather as a governor.

- "Mehmed the Conqueror was the true founder of the Ottoman Empire."
- Mehmed appointed [Gennadius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennadius_Scholarius) as Orthodox patriarch, and ordered him to write [The Confession of Faith](https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2016/10/the-confession-of-faith-of-gennadios.html). He invited [Gentile Bellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentile_Bellini) to paint. 
- A Janissary revolt and a general reaction against Mehmed II's administrative and bellicose policies followed his death in 1481. There was a period where Bellini's frescos were broken up. Beyazid II (1481-1512) came to the throne, instead of his brother [Cem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cem_Sultan), but effective power temporarily remained in the hands of [Gedik Ahmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedik_Ahmed_Pasha) and his father-in-law, [Ishak Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishak_Pasha).
- [Kizilbas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qizilbash) were mainly Turkoman Shia militant groups in the central Anatolian steppes. They adhered to dervish orders which professed a shamanistic, tribal heterodox version of Islam. In about 1500 [Ismail Safavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_I), first shah of [Safavid Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_Iran), was their religious leader. They [rebelled in 1511](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Şahkulu_rebellion), led by [sipahis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sipahi). So, Selim (1512-20) came to power, killed 40000 kizilbas and won [Battle of Chaldiran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chaldiran) in 1514. This caused a mass migration of Turkoman tribes to Iran.
- Mamluks of Egypt were [pressured by Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk–Portuguese_conflicts). Sherif of Mecca asked Selim for help. Selim won [Ottoman–Mamluk War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman–Mamluk_War_(1516–1517)) (1516–1517), took Mecca, Damascus and Jerusalem.
- "Up to 1596 there was no question of international politics which did not somehow involve the Ottomans".
