## Triangular Diplomacy and the Korean War
- [China White Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_White_Paper) (1949): a State Department report ordered by Dean Acheson to address criticism over the [Loss of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_China), explaining U.S. policy toward China as Communist forces neared victory.
- "... acts conceived as defensive in China may be treated as aggressive by the outside world; deterrent moves by the West may be interpreted in China as encirclement."
- "In September and October 1950, when the N[KPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Army) were being driven back by the U.S. 8th Army, Stalin – writing under the pseudonym ‘Fyn Si’ – did send two long letters giving military advice to [Kim Il Sung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il_Sung)." [Reference](https://www.johndclare.net/KoreanWar_Stalin.htm)
- There is a telegram from Mao to Stalin (p. 141) (1950 October) of which two contradictory versions are held in the archives of Beijing and Moscow. This suggests that as Chinese troops advanced toward Korea, the Chinese leadership was still debating. As a result of the war, U.S. also showed an inability to harmonize political and military goals.


## China Confronts Both Superpowers

Khrushchev secretly visited Beijing in an unsuccessful attempt to salvage the proposal. Three weeks later [Second Taiwan Strait Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis) started. This trick made Eisenhower believe cooperation and forced Khrushchev's hand.
- [Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotations_from_Chairman_Mao_Tse-tung): Also known as Little Red Book.

- "How to communicate this decision? The Warsaw ambassadorial talks had not been convened for months and would have been too low-level to present a view of such magnitude. The administration therefore decided to go to the other extreme and go public..."
- "Diplomacy to them [the Chinese] is the elaboration of a strategic principle [weaving together political, military, and psychological elements]" and "... once negotiations begin, they [negotiations] are seen [by U.S.] as being propelled by their own internal logic."

## Resumption of Relations: First Encounters with Mao and Zhou

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/nixon-mao.jpg" alt="nixon-mao" width="500"/>
</div>


- During Kissinger’s first visit, he feigned illness to buy time and preserve the secrecy of the meeting.
- "The advisor of the prince occasionally faces the dilemma of balancing the benefits of the ability to alter events against the possibility of exclusion... How does one measure the element of nuance over time against the claims of absolutes in the immediate?"
- "The difference is that Chinese leaders relate the friendship less to personal qualities and more to long-term cultural, national, or historic ties; Americans stress the individual qualities of their counterparts."
- In those first exchanges in the summer of 1971, Zhou outlines a new approach to international relations: "Chairman Mao on many occasions has said that we would absolutely not become a superpower. What we strive for is that all countries, big or small, be equal."
- Alexander the Great confronted the [Gordian Knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot), resolved it by cutting through it. It became a metaphor for bold, unconventional solutions to seemingly impossible problems. This was term was in the book regarding Zhou's initial handling of the Taiwan issue.
- The communique for the Nixon's visit had a deadlock over who would be said to have invited whom. Mao approved a version where Nixon "expressed desire to visit" and Mao "extended [additional to Kissinger] an invitation" and Nixon had "accepted with pleasure".
- Mao's residence: No visible guards, a small anteroom filled with a Ping-Pong table. Mao's study was "a room of modest size with bookshelves lining three walls... disarray. Books covered the tables and were piled up on the floor. A simple wooden bed stood in a corner."
- Mao mockingly observes himself: "... people like me sound a lot of big cannons. That is, things like 'the whole world should unite and defeat imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, and establish socialism'". See p. 262.
- "Usually men of strong will... may not be able to resolve deadlocks when time is short and the media insistent. As a result, diplomats frequently arrive at major meetings with communiques already largely drafted."

## The Quasi-Alliance: Conversations with Mao
- [Containment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment) was a U.S. Cold War policy preventing communism’s spread. See [X Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Article) by George F. Kennan, 1947. Mao had talks with the U.S. examining containment’s periphery, country by country.
- Mao, 1973: "You say, away with you Communists. We say, away with you imperialists. Sometimes we say things like that. It would not do not to do that." Kissinger: "Ideology would be relegated to domestic management; it took a leave from foreign policy."
- [Watergate scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal): 1972. Mao said "it was not necessary to conduct Watergate affair in that manner." It led to [War Powers Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution). The impact was negative on China-U.S. relations.

## The End of the Mao Era
- [Lin Biao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Biao) (1907–1971): Chinese military leader and Mao’s chosen successor, later accused of plotting a coup and killed in a plane crash. Contributed to the succession crisis.
- [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four): Ideologists, Maoist as opposed to practical and Confucian like Deng and Zhou (Zhou explodes when Kissinger implies they remained Confucian, see p. 299). Led by Jiang Qing, Mao’s wife. They were arrested shortly after Mao's death. See [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unuGt6Bq2io) from their trial. [Wang Hongwen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Hongwen) was the youngest member, who enjoyed a meteoric rise from being a security guard at a factory to the third position in the party. 
- [Red Detachment of Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Detachment_of_Women_(ballet)): Chinese ballet, premiered in 1964 and dominated the national stage during the Cultural Revolution. It was also performed for Nixon in 1972.
- [Three Worlds Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Worlds_Theory): Mao's 1970s Chinese Cold War theory classifying superpowers, developed states, and developing nations for strategic alignment purposes.
- Mao: "... God blesses you [Kissinger, Americans], not us. God does not like us because I am a militant warlord, also a communist".
- Mao used the [Dunkirk evacuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation) to make a point in a conversation. He was also using a similar argument of retreating and having a guerrilla war if necessary, for a completely different point. See [Long March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March).

## The Indestructible Deng
- Deng Xiaoping’s son fell from a Beijing university building in 1968 after Red Guards detained and abused him during the Cultural Revolution, leaving him permanently paralyzed.
- Deng: ["The Army Needs To Be Consolidated"](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/deng-xiaoping/1975/11.htm). See also [Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rules_of_Discipline_and_Eight_Points_for_Attention).
- Successor to Mao, Hua Guofeng said [Two Whatevers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Whatevers): "We will resolutely uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made, and unswervingly follow whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave". He organized the arrest of Gang of Four and quickly got replaced by Deng.
- Deng stressed the importance of decentralization and creativity. He advocated that the consumer goods had to have priority over heavy industry etc. Deng: [Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth From Facts and Unite As One In Looking to the Future](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/deng-xiaoping/1978/110.htm). Also see [Seek truth from facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seek_truth_from_facts), an expression from 111 CE from Book of Han, popularized by Mao.
- Around 1976, America's total trade with China was lower than its trade with Honduras and one-tenth of its trade with Taiwan, which had approximately 1.6 percent of China's population.
- Kissinger: "The revolutionary's dilemma... the more existing obligations are dismantled, the more force must be used to re-create a sense of obligation. Hence the frequent outcome of revolution is an increase in central power... The dilemma of reform is the opposite. The more the scope of choice is expanded, the harder it becomes to compartmentalize it."

## "Touching the Tiger's Buttocks"
- "Hanoi was not any other country's proxy. It fought for its vision of independence and, ultimately, for an Indochinese Federation." and "... Chinese culture provided Vietnam with a Chinese-style Confucian elite who possessed something of a regional Middle kingdom complex of their own..."
- [Khmer Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge) was a Cambodian communist movement ruling Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, responsible for mass killings. [Pol Pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot) was their leader. China supported them during the [Third Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War). Due to their genocidal conduct, "... no American President could treat them as another stone in the wei qi strategy... [However,] American ideals had encountered the imperatives of geopolitical reality."
- Before China attacked Vietnam in early 1979, Deng visited U.S. also in early 1979. One of the purposes was to intimidate the Soviet Union. In this sense, it is similar to Mao's visit to Russia before Second Taiwan Strait Crisis.
- [Carthago delenda est](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthago_delenda_est)

## Reagan and the Advent of Normalcy

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/deng-rodeo.jpeg" alt="deng-rodeo" width="500"/>
</div>

- Ronald Reagan balanced ideology and geopolitics, issuing the [Third Communiqué](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Communiqués#3rd), preserving Taiwan ties while stabilizing triangular relations with Beijing through ambiguity. He had good personal relationship with Taiwanese executives and said "no more betrayals".
- Reagan quotes [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) (Book of Changes, 1000-750 BC), which is an ancient Chinese [divination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination) classic. He says "同利合作" - "Tóng lì hé zuò" - "connect strength, work together" and "互敬互惠" - "Hù jìng hù huì" - "mutual respect, mutual benefit". 
- Kissinger: "Central planning, moreover, provided few incentives to emphasize quality or innovation. Since all a manager produced would be bought by a relevant ministry, quality was not a consideration. And innovation was, in effect, discouraged lest it throw the whole planning edifice out of kilter."
- China experienced a systematic decentralization. The state kept ownership, but gave managers real authority to run enterprises independently. See [Reform and opening up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_and_opening_up). China joined the IMF and World Bank in April 1980.
- Deng's protégé [Hu Yaobang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Yaobang) suggests that Chinese abandon chopsticks for knives and forks.
