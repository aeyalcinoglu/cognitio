- "... acts conceived as defensive in China may be treated as aggressive by the outside world; deterrent moves by the West may be interpreted in China as encirclement."
- "In September and October 1950, when the N[KPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Army) were being driven back by the US 8th Army, Stalin – writing under the pseudonym ‘Fyn Si’ – did send two long letters giving military advice to [Kim Il Sung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il_Sung)." [Reference](https://www.johndclare.net/KoreanWar_Stalin.htm)
- There is a telegram from Mao to Stalin (p. 141) (1950 October) of which two contradictory versions are held in the archives of Beijing and Moscow.
